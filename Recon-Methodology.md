# Ultimate Reconnaissance RoadMap for Bug Bounty Hunters & Pentesters

**What is Reconnaissance?**

* Reconnaissance also known as Information Gathering and Footprinting, is the first step and action that hackers do when approaching a target to search for weaknesses and use the advantage of vulnerabilities found in Exploiting the target system.

1. The first step is to identify the technology used to build your target

# Common Mistakes Made by Bug Bounty Hunters as a beginner

1. Not thoroughly understanding the scope of the program.
2. Jumping for exploitation without understanding the application.
3. Not properly testing for all types of vulnerabilities.
4. Not learning from mistakes.
5. Changing my target consistently, and not being patient.

# Enumeration, fuzzing, and directory brute forcing.

**How To use ffuf tool**

1. ffuf -u http://MACHINE_IP/indexFUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt **this wordlist used to identify what extension supported backend server its useful to find relavant directories**
2. ffuf -u http://MACHINE_IP/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-files-lowercase.txt -e .php,.txt -mc 200 **this command include file extension and filter status code**

**How to use dirsearch**

1. sudo dirsearch -e* -u https://www.example.com/ -t 30 -o output.txt **this command used to include all extension and save the output file**
