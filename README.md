# What is authentication?

* Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client. Websites are potentially exposed to anyone who is connected to the internet. This makes robust authentication mechanisms integral to effective web security.

**There are three main types of authentication:**

1. Something you know, such as a password or the answer to a security question. These are sometimes called "knowledge factors".
2. Something you have, This is a physical object such as a mobile phone or security token. These are sometimes called "possession factors".
3. Something you are or do. For example, your biometrics or patterns of behavior. These are sometimes called "inherence factors".

# What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

* Authentication is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be. Authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something.

* For example, authentication determines whether someone attempting to access a website with the username Carlos123 really is the same person who created the account.

* Once Carlos123 is authenticated, their permissions determine what they are authorized to do. For example, they may be authorized to access personal information about other users, or perform actions such as deleting another user's account. 

# How do authentication vulnerabilities arise?

**Most vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms occur in one of two ways:**

1. The authentication mechanisms are weak because they fail to adequately protect against brute-force attacks.
2. Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the authentication mechanisms to be bypassed entirely by an attacker. This is sometimes called "broken authentication".

# What is Rate Limiting?

* Rate limiting is used to control the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic to or from a network. If the number of requests you make exceeds that limit, then an error will be triggered. The reasoning behind implementing rate limits is to allow for a better flow of data and to increase security by mitigating attacks such as DDoS.
  
# What is No Rate Limiting Vulnerability?

* No rate limit means there is no mechanism to protect against requests you made in a short frame of time. So try to send lots of requests, if it is not blocking you then you can consider it as vulnerability.

# Why Password Reset Page?

* Most of the web application provides users “ password reset “ functionality via email. This functionality has given which allow users to recover their account, generate a new password, and repair their own problems. so let’s start and learn how to look for bugs in this function.

# No rate limit at signup page

**How To Hunt:**

1. Enter your details in signup form and submit the form
2. Capture the signup request and send it to intruder
3. add $$ to email parameter
4. In the payload add different email address
5. Fire up intruder and check whether it return 200 ok

# Email Verfication Bypass leads to account takeover 

1. Try registering any email address without verifying it.
2. Try registering an account again, but this time with a different method, such as ‘sign up with Google’ from same email address.
3. see it will be successfully bypasses the Email verification methods.
4. What happens here is, now the attacker can easily log in using the victim's account which bypasses the verification methods.

# No rate limiting on password reset
  Rate limiting is used to control the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic to or from a network. Basically, no rate limit means there is no mechanism to protect against requests you made in a short frame of time. So try to send lots of requests, if it is not blocking you then you can consider it as vulnerability.

**How To Hunt:**

  1. Go to https://example.com/resetPassword/
  2. Enter the email then click reset password
  3. Intercept this request in burp suite
  4. Send it to the intruder and repeat it by 50 times
  5. You will get 200 OK status

# Password Reset Link not expiring after changing the email
  when a user request changing password then he get a password reset link to reset the password, that’s the normal behaviour but it also should expire after some period of time. If it is not expiring and you can use the password reset link multiple times to reset the password. Then you can consider it as vulnerability.

**How To Hunt:**

  1. Send the password reset link to your email.
  2. Don`t open the password link just copy it and paste into any editor.
  3. Open your account.
  4. Go to your account settings.
  5. Under account, you will see Account Overview.
  6. Go to the Email and password Option and change the email and verify it.
  7. After changing the email go to your password reset link which you copied.
  8. Change your password.

# Password Reset Link not expiring after changing password

**How To Hunt:**

  1. First You need to create an account with a Valid Email Address
  2. After Creating An Account log out from your Account and Navigate to Forgot Password Page
  3. Request a Password Reset Link for your Account
  4. Use The Password Reset Link And Change The Password, After Changing the Password Login to Your Account
  5. Now Use The Old Password Reset Link To Change The Password Again
  6. If You Are Able to Change Your Password Again Than This Is a Bug

# Denial of service when entering a long password
  Normally passwords have 8–12–24 or up to 48 digits. if there is no word limit while keeping a password you can consider it as vulnerability. you can check when you setting the password while changing passwords or creating accounts as a long string which can lead to DOS.

**How to Hunt:**

  1. Go Sign up page and Forgot password page
  2. Fill the form and enter a long string in password
  3. Click on enter and you’ll get 500 Internal Server error if it is vulnerable.

# Password reset token leak via referer

  The HTTP referrer is an optional HTTP header field that identifies the address of the webpage which is linked to the resource being requested. The Referer request-header contains the address of the previous web page from which a link to the currently requested page was followed. So it is possible that the password reset token is leaking via referrer request-header.

**How To Hunt:**

  1. Go to terget website and request for password reset
  2. Now check your email you will get your password reset link
  3. Now just copy the link and go to the private mode and paste the link
  4. Don't change the password before that click on any external links like social media links for avaliable one same website.
  5. Capture that request in burp suite.
  6. You will find reset token in referer header.

# Full account takeover through reset password

1. Navigate to: https://app.upchieve.org/resetpassword
2. Then, enter the victim's email address
3. Intercept this request
4. Now, add your email also in the JSON body. like this: **{"email":["victim@gmail.com","your@gmail.com"]}**
5. Forward this request
6. Now victim and you will receive the same password reset link
7. By using that link which you just received in your email
8. You can fully takeover the victim's account by reset password.

# Password Reset link hijacking via Host Header Poisoning 
  Password reset poisoning is a technique whereby an attacker manipulates a vulnerable website into generating a password reset link pointing to a domain under their control. This behaviour can be leveraged to steal the secret tokens required to reset arbitrary users’ passwords and, ultimately, compromise their accounts.
  
**How To Hunt:**

1. Intercept the password reset request in Burp Suite
2. Add or edit the following headers in Burp Suite : Host: attacker.com, X-Forwarded-Host: attacker.com
3. Forward the request with the modified header 
4. Look for a password reset URL based on the host header like : https://attacker.com/reset-password.php?token=TOKEN

* X-Forwarded-By: bing.com
* X-Forwarded-For: bing.com
* X-Forwarded-For-Original: bing.com
* X-Forwarder-For: bing.com
* X-Forward-For: bing.com
* Forwarded-For: bing.com
* Forwarded-For-Ip: bing.com
* X-Custom-Ip-Authorization: bing.com
* X-Originating-Ip: bing.com
* X-Remote-Ip: bing.com
* X-Remote-Addr: bing.com


# Rate Limit Bypass Techniques

**There are two ways to do that**

**1. Customizing HTTP Methods**

* If the request goes on GET try to change it to POST, PUT, etc.,
* If you wanna bypass the rate-limit in API's try HEAD method.

**2. Adding Headers to Spoof IP**

* X-Forwarded: 127.0.0.1
* X-Forwarded-By: 127.0.0.1
* X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
* X-Forwarded-For-Original: 127.0.0.1
* X-Forwarder-For: 127.0.0.1
* X-Forward-For: 127.0.0.1
* Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
* Forwarded-For-Ip: 127.0.0.1
* X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 127.0.0.1
* X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1
* X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1
* X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1

# Bypass Rate Limit when there’s a CAPTCHA
  You must have encountered a Google CAPTCHA while testing Website. These are some ways with the help of which you can bypass it.

1. Try Removing CAPTCHA Parameter from the body of the Request.
2. Try adding some String of the same length as that of the Parameter.
3. Keep the Intercept ON, Send Request to Intruder. Sometimes, It may give unexpected results.

# Bypassing Rate Limit with some Characters

1. Adding Null Byte ( %00 ) at the end of the Email can sometimes Bypass Rate Limit.
2. Try adding a Space Character after a Email. ( Not Encoded )
3. Some Common Characters that help bypassing Rate Limit : %0d , %2e , %09 , %20

# How to mitigate No Rate Limiting ?

* Implement Captcha: Captcha is a common system to verify a human is a human on websites and can stop brute force attacks in progress
* Implement X-Rate-Limiting Header: We can set rate limiting with this header.
